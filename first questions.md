### Is the app **replase**(ing) current environment of fb, twitter, reddit, stack etc. ?<br>

Replase means not displacing the current system but putting in place another system, which doesn't at all disturb the user space, once the current is disolved.

##### What is the current system giving?<br>
One.<br>
It's giving variable returns disproportionately. some are getting 1x return, some 100x, many 1000x and some x10000000.<br>
Where the current average salary of the world is 1500$ or 1,20,000 per month.


##### What is the system not giving?<br>
One.<br>
Those getting 1x or 100x returns are turning to other modes of getting the 1000x and rarely x10000000 and even x100000000 and just three getting x1000000000 return.

###### What can be done 
##### To replase (1)
One.<br>
Get everybody on x1000 plane.<br>
Two. <br>
Keep the disproportion, cause disturbance creates bad consequences.

##### Caveat<br> 
To game change: (2)<br> 
One.<br>
Get everybody to relative x10000 by redistribution.<br>

##### To the reader
(1) and (2) are equal.
