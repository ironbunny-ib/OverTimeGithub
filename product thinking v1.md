# Product Thinking - v1
##### Some Tenants
- the goal of the product is to solve user problems
- the goal of UX is to make the product successful
- the goal of UI is to keep it simple


##### With these things in my mind:
We want to allow you to create products
1. With code
2. Without code<br>
_Yes, there is a third option : mixed :_
3. With and Without Code

If you decide to make a product for us, we give you 2 things
1. A unified UX integration <br>
_Our Legion and Point Progression System_
2. Marketing Stream <br>
_All our Prowess Democratized without Bias_

<br><br>
Now, what do you have to do -- <br>
The most important part is to have a theory that will be reviewed by us.
<br><br>

Answer questions like - <br>
What is the basis of the product? <br>
What is the crux which motivates me/us to explore solutions?
<br><br>

Verify -- <br>
Is it unidentified as a base to build from? <br>
Is it explorable for centuries?
<br><br>

When you have identified a core, proceed in a sharable vision, better yet in a divergent vision, towards capturing the human market.
