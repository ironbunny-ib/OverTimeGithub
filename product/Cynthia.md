## Creation

**What all is going on here**<br>

**About Cynthiating**<br>


**About how the reward structure helps in putting forward the power of Cynthiating**<br>


**For the uninitiated, your earned points are used to spend on consuming, that is for eg. reading somebody else's klutes**<br>

**For the uninitiated, your earned points are used to level up into legions. As you reach higher legions, the quality of Klutes keeps improving.**<br>

**Dynamic [#gybfrtypl98308](https://github.com/ironbunny-ib/OverTimeGithub/blob/master/Dynamics.md)**<br>
Reaching a legion where nobody else is their to view.<br>
We have to keep in mind and wait for the rest of kluters to reach the creators legion as that is how things work.<br>
People will reach higher legions.<br>
And also the previous Klutes will still keep gaining points, as more and more kluters like them.<br>

**The worth of writing more in each klute**<br>

**What are the constraints**<br>


**Tasks**<br>
Keep working on the creation part and make it an even more compelling space to klute
