## Creation
![Klutes Creation](/assets/pictures/creationKlutes.svg)

**What all is going on here**
There is the main theme of writing klutes, for that we have made some rewarding structure, and some constraint structure.<br>

**About Kluting**
There is an ability to write upto 100 Klutes. We can market as a limit or as a unlimited feature. You tell which one is correct .<br>
Each Klute except the first requires atleast 140 characters and at most 230 characters. The first Klute has a lower limit of 5 characters.<br>
The lower limit allows the creator to feign interest for the right reasons like creating sense of anticipation.<br>
Good Kluters can capitalize on this and deliver powerful follow up messages.<br>

**About how the reward structure helps in putting forward the power of Kluting**
Writing is not easy, and great writers know it.<br>
What are the words which will satiate their audience are not to be taken unseriously at all.<br>
We reward this careful consideration to the extent of each character which touches the screen.<br>
To be exact 4 points, per character are earned.

**For the unitiated, your earned points are used to spend on consuming, that is for eg. reading somebody else's klutes**





## Consumption

## Product
**Klutes is for contemplation.**

**What is contemplation?**
<br>There can be many definitions!

>Directed thoughts when imagined forward towards the future or backwards towards the past are contemplations.

>Not being in the present is contemplation.<br>
>Not being the present and bringing some valuable insight is Kluting.

**How would you describe the process of contemplation to a child?**

>A.<br>Ask the child<br>What do you do when you're stuck <br>And that's when the child starts to contemplate<br> And then tell the child what he was doing was contemplation

>B.<br> "Have you ever had to do something without knowing how it would end up?"

**One directive of user segmenting according to _meaning of contemplation_ in a user's life:**
1. College Goers can have the theme of "Imagine things beyond your reach"<br>
    - **Example Execution:** Get Interests > fetch headlines about interests > send notification to her/him
2. Young Adults could contemplate to give meaning to their lives<br>
    - **Example Execution:** get concerns like money, socialising, achievement, social work, poverty, titles, ... 
       - **Inner** Example Execution: find articles, and ask them to write in their own words
3. Mid-aged people can write already contemplated stuff which are from their domain of work such as Bankers, Engineers, Marketers, Product People, Music Artists <br>
    - **Example Execution:** Send notifications to banker which motivates him to write his expertise on Klutes
4. Old People can post helpful guidlines, stuff which gives us gratefulness, ... , ...<br>
    - **Example Execution:** ask how they feel now, coax to create what they want youngsters to understand
    
**Smething that can be made a tactic**<br>
