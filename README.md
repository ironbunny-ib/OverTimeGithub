# OverTimeGithub
#### everbody, **RISE!** : )
<br>OT has 3 branches today on 21-May-2020 :
<br>
 - Tech
 - Product
 - Marketing
<br>

I intend to opensource all three. Truth be told, I am not really sure
how to do this, but I have ideas and will try them.<br><br>

#

Why is OT different?<br><br>
There is a gap between the tech community and general community.<br>
OT aims to close that - <br>

The former is very protective as cases of StackOverflow. They are not interested in ideas of common folk.<br>
The latter is not respectful enough of the former. Where tech is our NorthStar, 
in some markets I have noticed that the former works in silos or even sweat shops.(Overexaggeration)<br>
This should not be happening.<br>

OT is a tech company which adores people, animals and even inanimate matter. We love an asteroid and we love a lady **bug**<br>

Declaration : 
> We are always highly alert and aware of apparent threats of Artificial General Intelligence and purposefully create a future which is disparitively different as that in media, movies and ransackers. As we aim to be opensource in all our dealings, even money, things shall be questioned and reflected always, so we stay true to this.

The world changes very fast, and though our purpose is to accelerate this to alleviate poverty, sins,.... we understand business cycles and people
are not very understanding sometimes, so, may our thinking evolve, our processes may lag and we need your help there to be patient with us.
