# Dissolution of Specific Marketing 

> As humans we are deeply attracted to growth in our spheres of life.<br>
> This deep desire is 'utter vast' in Nature.<br>
> We want to be one with Nature and have it all, because we deserve it all too.<br>

##### Keeping that in mind:
We aim to showcase the epitome of this specific marketing group, constantly disseminating our **sheez** and finally reach a point where it's all done and said.
<br>
If and when we reach this junction, we dissolve this specific sect of marketing to be taken up by who desires deeply.
